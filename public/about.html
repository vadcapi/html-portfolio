<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! Welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Vadym Hrabovskyi and I'm excited to share my story with you. 
</p>
<p>I believe that hard work, dedication, and a willingness to learn can take me far. Let me tell you a bit about my experiences and skills.
</p>
<p>I have gained experience as a courier at Wolt and Glovo in Poland and Ukraine, where I have honed my skills in customer service, navigation, and work scheduling. During my time as a blogger, I learned how to write blog posts, video scripts, and edit videos. I have a strong command of English, Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish, and I am a strong PC and Android user.
</p>
<p>I worked as a Junior System Administrator and maintained computer equipment for a small chain of stores. This role helped me develop my skills in troubleshooting and creative thinking. I graduated as Junior Specialist in Servicing of Computer Systems and Networks from Kherson Polytechnic College of Odessa National Polytechnic University and graduated from Secondary School #56 in Kherson, Ukraine.
</p>
<p>Aside from my technical skills, I am a camera-friendly person with a passion for filmmaking, script writing, and color-grading. I have also organized events and adapted well to different environments. I am a hardworking individual with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. 
</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I am confident that my skills and experience will make me a valuable addition to your team. If you have any questions or would like to chat further, please don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
